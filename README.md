This C program controls a sequence of 10 LEDs on a shield using an ATmega328P microcontroller, creating a running light effect. Each LED lights up for approximately 1 second before passing the illumination to the next. The program leverages Timer/Counter0 to generate interrupts at 1 kHz, ensuring precise LED sequencing.
